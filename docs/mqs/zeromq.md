Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform. We think of a streaming platform as having three key capabilities:

1. It lets you publish and subscribe to stream of records.
2. It lets you store streams of records in a fault-tolerant way.
3. It lets you process streams of records as they occur.

First a few concepts:
* Kafka is run as a cluster on one or more servers.
* The Kafka cluster stores streams of records in categories called topics.
* Each record consists of a key, a value, and a timestamp.
